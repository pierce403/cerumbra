# Cerumbra üîê

**End-to-End Encrypted Conversations with GPUs**

Cerumbra is a protocol and implementation for private, secure AI inference using browser-to-TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) encryption. It enables completely private conversations with GPU-accelerated AI models running in NVIDIA Blackwell TEEs, ensuring your prompts and responses remain encrypted throughout the entire inference process.

## üåü Features

- **üîí End-to-End Encryption**: Data encrypted from browser to GPU TEE using AES-256-GCM
- **‚úì Remote Attestation**: Cryptographically verify TEE authenticity before sharing data
- **‚ö° GPU Acceleration**: Leverage NVIDIA Blackwell TEE for high-performance encrypted inference
- **üîë ECDH Key Exchange**: Secure key establishment with forward secrecy
- **üåä Streaming Responses**: Low-latency streaming of encrypted inference results
- **üåê Decentralized Ready**: Foundation for the decentralized Cerumbra Network

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Cerumbra implements a secure communication protocol between web browsers and GPU TEEs:

1. **Browser Client**: Generates ephemeral ECDH key pair using Web Crypto API
2. **TEE Attestation**: GPU TEE provides cryptographic proof of authenticity
3. **Key Exchange**: ECDH establishes shared secret, HKDF derives encryption keys
4. **Encrypted Inference**: Prompts encrypted in browser, decrypted in TEE, responses encrypted before streaming back

### Technology Stack

- **Browser**: Web Crypto API (ECDH P-256, AES-GCM, HKDF)
- **TEE**: NVIDIA Blackwell Trusted Execution Environment (simulated in demo)
- **Transport**: WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Server**: Python with cryptography library

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Modern web browser with Web Crypto API support
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierce403/cerumbra.git
cd cerumbra
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install websockets cryptography
```

### Running the Demo

1. Start the simulated TEE server:
```bash
python3 server.py
```

You should see:
```
============================================================
Cerumbra TEE Server (Simulated)
============================================================
Starting server on ws://localhost:8765
Waiting for browser connections...
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
```bash
# On macOS:
open index.html

# On Linux:
xdg-open index.html

# Or simply open the file in your browser
```

3. Click "Connect to TEE" and follow the demo to experience:
   - Key pair generation
   - Attestation verification
   - ECDH key exchange
   - Encrypted inference

### DGX Spark Launcher Scripts

For day-to-day use on a DGX Spark, the repo now includes launchers that wire up the simulated shielded inference stack:

- `./cerumbra-server.sh`  
  Installs Python dependencies (using `CERUMBRA_PYTHON_BIN` if provided), runs the Cerumbra verification suite, and performs a NVIDIA Blackwell + confidential-compute preflight before starting `server.py`. If the host is missing a Blackwell GPU or confidential computing is disabled, the launcher drops into an explicit simulation mode and prints remediation steps. By default it binds to `0.0.0.0:8765`; override via `CERUMBRA_SERVER_HOST` and `CERUMBRA_SERVER_PORT` or `--host/--port`.
- `./cerumbra-client.sh`  
  Serves the static web client with `python -m http.server` (bind/port configurable through `CERUMBRA_CLIENT_BIND` and `CERUMBRA_CLIENT_PORT`). Set `CERUMBRA_SERVER_URL` or append `?server=ws://host:port` to the browser URL so the UI points at your DGX Spark backend.

The intent is to run the server launcher directly on the DGX Spark node and point browser clients at it, but you can run both scripts on the same workstation for local development.

## üìñ How It Works

### 1. Key Generation

The browser generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair:

```javascript
const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    { name: "ECDH", namedCurve: "P-256" },
    true,
    ["deriveKey", "deriveBits"]
);
```

### 2. Attestation

The TEE provides a cryptographic attestation quote proving its authenticity:

```python
def generate_attestation(self, nonce: bytes) -> Dict:
    quote = {
        "measurements": self.state.measurements,  # PCR values
        "nonce": base64.b64encode(nonce).decode(),
        "teePublicKey": jwk
    }
    signature = self._sign_quote(quote)
    return {"quote": quote, "signature": signature, "certChain": ...}
```

### 3. Key Exchange

ECDH key exchange establishes a shared secret:

```javascript
const sharedSecret = await crypto.subtle.deriveBits(
    { name: "ECDH", public: teePublicKey },
    keyPair.privateKey,
    256
);

// Derive encryption key using HKDF
const encryptionKey = await deriveKey(sharedSecret, "cerumbra-v1");
```

### 4. Encrypted Inference

Prompts are encrypted before sending:

```javascript
const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: "AES-GCM", iv },
    encryptionKey,
    encoder.encode(prompt)
);
```

## üîê Security Model

### Security Guarantees

- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys ensure past communications remain secure
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides confidentiality and authenticity
- **TEE Protection**: Hardware-isolated execution with memory encryption
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of TEE authenticity

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- Network eavesdropping
- Malicious server operators
- Cloud infrastructure providers
- Man-in-the-middle attacks (with proper attestation verification)

**Assumptions:**
- TEE hardware is trustworthy
- Attestation infrastructure is trustworthy
- Client browser implements Web Crypto API correctly

**Out of Scope:**
- Physical attacks on TEE hardware
- Side-channel attacks on TEE
- Compromised client endpoints

## üß™ Development

### Browser-Side Development

The browser implementation is pure JavaScript using Web Crypto API. Key files:

- `demo.js`: Contains `CerumbraClient` class implementing:
  - Key generation
  - Attestation verification
  - ECDH key exchange
  - AES-GCM encryption/decryption

### Server-Side Development

The server is Python-based using:
- `websockets`: WebSocket server
- `cryptography`: ECDH, HKDF, AES-GCM implementations

Key class: `CerumbraTEE` in `server.py`

### Testing Locally

1. Start server: `python3 server.py`
2. Open browser console (F12)
