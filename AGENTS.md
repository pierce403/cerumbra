# Cerumbra Agent Operating Notes

- Always commit and push every set of changes immediately after completing the requested update. Do not leave local-only work in the tree.
- When conversations become lengthy, record any notable decisions, context, or follow-up actions in this file so future agents have a quick reference.

## Recent Work

### Oct 22, 2025 - ccadm-setup.sh Fixes
- **Fixed critical syntax error**: Line 375 had `}` instead of `esac` in case statement
- **Repository investigation**: Tested all NVIDIA repo URLs - CUDA repos work (HTTP 200), but confidential computing repos return 404
- **Key finding**: nvidia-ccadm package NOT in public repositories; likely bundled with NVIDIA driver 550+ for H100/Blackwell GPUs
- **Improvements**: Added comprehensive error handling, diagnostic output, system info display, and graceful handling of unavailable repos
- **Created test-nvidia-repos.sh**: Systematic verification script for repository availability
- **Documentation**: CCADM-SETUP-FIXES.md contains complete findings and testing results
- **Status**: Script is now syntactically correct and ready for testing on DGX Spark hardware with appropriate drivers
- **Recommendation**: On DGX Spark, first install/verify NVIDIA driver 550+ which should include nvidia-ccadm
