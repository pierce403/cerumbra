# ccadm-setup.sh Fixes and Findings

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Issue:** Script had syntax errors and repository availability issues

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: DGX Spark GB10 Does NOT Support Confidential Computing

**Hardware Limitation:** The NVIDIA DGX Spark with GB10 chip **does not support confidential computing**. This is a hardware limitation confirmed by NVIDIA representatives.

**Source:** https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/confidential-computing-support-for-dgx-spark-gb10/347945

**Requirements for Confidential Computing:**
- NVIDIA H100 GPUs (Hopper architecture)
- Compatible CPU with TEE support (AMD SEV-SNP or Intel TDX)

**Impact:** The ccadm-setup.sh script will now detect GB10 GPUs and exit with a clear warning. Cerumbra will run in simulation mode on DGX Spark systems.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Syntax Error (Line 375)
- **Problem:** Case statement ended with `}` instead of `esac`
- **Fix:** Changed closing brace to `esac`
- **Impact:** Script now passes bash syntax validation

### 2. Repository Availability Issues
Testing revealed that several NVIDIA repositories are not publicly available:

#### Working Repositories:
- ✓ CUDA repos: `https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu{2004,2204,2404}/x86_64/`
- ✓ cuda-keyring package: Available for download
- ✓ Repository metadata files (Release, InRelease): HTTP 200

#### Not Available:
- ✗ Confidential computing repos: `https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/confidential-computing/repos/` - HTTP 404
- ✗ DGX Base OS repos: `https://repo.download.nvidia.com/baseos/ubuntu/` - HTTP 404
- ✗ nvidia-ccadm package: Not found in public CUDA repositories

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed diagnostic output showing HTTP status codes
- Repository verification now shows whether endpoints are accessible
- Non-fatal warnings when optional repos are unavailable
- Comprehensive error messages with manual installation guidance

### 4. Better User Guidance
- System information display (OS, kernel, driver, GPU)
- Step-by-step next actions after script completion
- Clear documentation of expected vs. actual behavior
- Helpful error messages explaining possible causes

### 5. Test Script Created
Created `test-nvidia-repos.sh` to systematically verify:
- Repository URL accessibility
- Package availability
- System configuration
- Current driver/GPU status

## Key Findings

### nvidia-ccadm Package Distribution
The nvidia-ccadm package is **not** available through standard public repositories. Likely distribution methods:

1. **Bundled with NVIDIA Drivers**
   - May be included in driver 550+ for H100/Blackwell GPUs
   - Recommend: `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-550-server`

2. **NVIDIA Enterprise/DGX Channels**
   - May require NVIDIA Enterprise subscription
   - DGX-specific installation media
   - Direct support from NVIDIA

3. **Hardware Requirements**
   - Confidential computing requires compatible GPUs (H100 Hopper, Blackwell)
   - DGX Spark systems should have appropriate drivers pre-installed

### Testing on DGX Spark
When running on actual DGX Spark hardware:

1. **Check if nvidia-ccadm is already installed:**
   ```bash
   which nvidia-ccadm
   nvidia-ccadm --version
   ```

2. **Verify GPU support:**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,uuid --format=csv
   ```

3. **Check driver version:**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv
   ```
   - Driver 550+ recommended for H100/Blackwell confidential computing

4. **If nvidia-ccadm is missing:**
   - Install/upgrade NVIDIA drivers
   - Contact NVIDIA DGX support
   - Check if system came with DGX-specific installation media

## Script Improvements

### Before:
- Hard failure if confidential computing repo unavailable
- Minimal diagnostic output
- Syntax error preventing execution
- No indication of what repositories were being checked

### After:
- Graceful handling of unavailable repositories
- Detailed diagnostic output with HTTP codes
- All syntax errors fixed
- System information display
- Comprehensive error messages
- Test script for verification
- Clear next steps for users

## Verification Commands

Test the script syntax:
```bash
bash -n ccadm-setup.sh
```

Run the repository test:
```bash
./test-nvidia-repos.sh
```

Test on DGX Spark (requires sudo):
```bash
sudo ./ccadm-setup.sh
```

## Documentation References

- NVIDIA Confidential Computing: https://docs.nvidia.com/confidential-computing/
- Script comments include repository status as of Oct 2025
- Test results logged for future reference

## Recommendations for DGX Spark Deployment

1. **Pre-flight Check:**
   - Run `test-nvidia-repos.sh` to verify system configuration
   - Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed and current
   - Verify GPU is Hopper H100 or Blackwell architecture

2. **Driver Installation:**
   - If nvidia-ccadm is missing, install recommended driver:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nvidia-driver-550-server
     sudo reboot
     ```

3. **After Driver Installation:**
   - Verify nvidia-ccadm is available
   - Run ccadm-setup.sh to enable confidential computing
   - Reboot as instructed
   - Verify with `nvidia-ccadm --status` and `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=conf_computing_mode`

4. **If Issues Persist:**
   - Contact NVIDIA DGX Support
   - Reference this document and test results
   - Provide output of `test-nvidia-repos.sh`

## Files Modified/Created

- ✏️ `ccadm-setup.sh` - Fixed syntax and improved error handling
- ✨ `test-nvidia-repos.sh` - New test script for repository verification
- ✨ `CCADM-SETUP-FIXES.md` - This documentation file

---

**Status:** Script is now syntactically correct and handles repository issues gracefully. Ready for testing on DGX Spark hardware with appropriate NVIDIA drivers installed.
